## Quiz 1: Introduction to Github and Version Control
__To be completed in one week (for Spring 2024, February 8).__ 

__1)__ before the assignment is issued on June 21, I will invite you to be a collaborator in the Orthogonal Research and Education Lab organization. Please [e-mail the instructor](mailto:balicea@illinois.edu) with your Github handle (URL of your account after the ".com/") in the body. Please check your e-mail (Main and Spam folders) for the invite and accept. If you cannot find the invite, contact me and I will resend.

__2)__ Create a fork of [OREL-group/project-management](https://github.com/OREL-group/Project-Management). Once you do so, I should be able to see your fork.

__3)__ Contribute to __NAMEFILE.md__ using the GUI interface: write your name to [NAMEFILE.md](https://github.com/OREL-group/Project-Management/blob/main/Quiz%201/NAMEFILE.md) beneath the instructor's name.

* make a note describing your changes to the file in the extended description window, then click "commit changes".

__4)__ Navigate to the "Quiz #1" directory and look inside.

__5)__ Prepare a document with multiple stylistic elements: create a new Markdown document in the "Quiz #1" directory. Name this document FIRSTNAME_LASTNAME.md. 

* create a document with at least three stylistic elements. Refer back to the online Markdown tutorial for these styles. For example, add headings and text elements in Markdown, an image with caption using HTML tags, and a table in .csv format. You may also use elements in .csv, LaTeX, Bookdown or other languages consistent with Github-flavored Markdown.

* test your code by "committing changes" and looking at the document. Keep doing this until everything in your document renders properly. If it does not render properly after repreated edits, it may be that your element is not compatible with Github-flavored Markdown. 

* do only what you are comfortable with and don't let this intimidate you. I look forward to see what you can do!

__6)__ Now that you have made your contribution, it is time to make a pull request! You will now push your work to the Orthogonal Research and Education Lab organizations repository.

* refresh your fork immediately before issuing your pull request. Click on "refresh fork" at the root of your Project Mnagement repository fork.

* go to the pull request tab, and click on "new pull request".

* check through the "comparing changes" page, and make sure your changed files are consistent with the base (should say "able to merge" with a check mark). 

* make a note that described the changes you have made, and click on "issue pull request" as was shown in the lecture slides. Leave a comment as neccessary.

__7)__ In preparation for your next quiz, please refresh your fork a few weeks after the submission deadline. This should bring it into sync, and you will be able to see how everyone did on their quiz!
